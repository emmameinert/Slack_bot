This Slack bot is designed to help users understand the meaning of acronyms and other terms that are commonly used in their workplace. With the use of simple commands, users can search, add, edit, or delete acronyms and their respective definitions. All commands will trigger the bot to open a direct message (DM) with the user who issued the command. This is where the bot will provide feedback and display the results of the command.

The primary functionality of the code revolves around reading from and writing to a JSON file that serves as a dictionary to store acronyms and their corresponding meanings. The dictionary is stored in a file named "dict.json".

Additionally, the code runs a Flask application on the default port 5000. It is important to note that the code is configured to run in debug mode, which enables helpful error messages and automatic code reloading during development.

## How to use acro-bot:
**Command 1: /acro**
  
The _/acro_ command allows users to search for the definition of an acronym. Here's how to use this command:
```
Syntax: /acro [acronym]
Example: /acro JSON
```
**Command 2: /acro-add**

The _/acro-add_ command allows users to add new acronyms or update existing ones along with their definitions. Here's how to use this command:
```
Syntax: /acro-add [acronym] "[definition]"
Example: /acro-add JSON "JavaScript Object Notation"
```
Note: The definition for the acronym should be enclosed in quotes. This is especially important when the definition has multiple words. If quotes are not used, only the first word after the acronym will be saved as the definition.

**Command 3: /acro-delete**

The _/acro-delete_ command allows users to delete an existing acronym and its definition from the bot's database. Here's how to use this command:
```
Syntax: /acro-delete [acronym]
Example: /acro-delete ETA
```
### Conclusion:
With the help of this bot, users can easily add or update acronyms and their definitions, making it easier for everyone in the workplace to understand the jargon used in their industry. Moreover, this bot's features can be customized to meet the specific requirements of different teams.

## Implementation of a basic slack-bot in a channel
Prerequisites:
- Slack account & Slack workspace
- ngrok account to run a server or access to private server.

Create a Bot:
- Slack API: Interacts with Slack and receives messages from users in Slack channels.
- Slack Bolt: Python framework that simplifies Slack app development, handling events and interactions with the Slack API.
- Flask: Web framework for the chatbot's server, handling incoming HTTP requests from Slack and serving endpoints.
- Add features and functionality: bots, permissions to configure what the bot will be able to do (e.g., chat:write, command, chat:history).
- Generate a token for the workspace. It creates a signing key and an author token we will need for the environment path. Remember to keep the Slack bot token and Slack signing secret!

Start coding:
- Create a .env file and add the Slack bot token and Slack signing secret. Keep them secure!
- Create a Python file and install the required libraries and packages:
- pip3 install slackclient (to connect to Slack)
- pip3 install python-dotenv (to read from the .env file)
- Install any other required libraries by running pip3 install <library_name> on Mac/Linux 
- (for Windows pip install <library name> suffices)

Connect to Slack:
- Find the environment path and connect to Slack with your tokens.
- Use Slack Bolt to handle events from Slack, specifically listening for app_mention events triggered when the bot is mentioned.
- Create a Slack Event Adapter using the Slack signing secret and /slack/events endpoint to receive events from Slack.
- To make the Slack bot running, you need a server, a possible provider is ngrok.
- Create an account on ngrok and set up your personalized token.
- Run: ngrok config add-authtoken <token>
- Run: ngrok http <your_local_port>
  
  ## The integration between Slack and ChatGPT would be achieved through the following components:
 
- Assuming the Slackbot above is implemented, only the differences are mentioned below:
- Besides Slack API, Slack Bolt, Flask:
  ChatGPT: OpenAI's advanced language model used to generate responses based on user prompts.
  Implementation Steps:
- Import additional necessary libraries and dependencies.
- Add OpenAI API key to .env file.
- Configure the Flask app, including SSL context creation for secure connections.
- Set up Slack integration by creating a WebClient instance with the Slack bot token.
- Define a function to handle app_mention events, extracting the user's input prompt, sending a confirmation message, generating a response with ChatGPT, and sending it back to the Slack channel.
- Create additional Flask endpoints for specific actions, such as handling acronyms.
- Use SlackRequestHandler from Slack Bolt to process incoming requests from Slack, integrated with the Flask app.
- Create a Slack Event Adapter using the Slack signing secret and /slack/events endpoint to receive events from Slack and pass them to Slack Bolt.
- Establish a connection between the chatbot and Slack with the app token and Slack Bolt app.
- Start the Flask app with app.run() method, specifying debug mode and server to listen on.
- Start the Slack Event Adapter to handle incoming events from Slack.

  Usage:
- Start the Flask app.
- Invite the chatbot to the desired Slack channel(s) where it should listen for messages.
